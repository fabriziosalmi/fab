## How to use
The hitchhiker's guide to DevGPT:

1. Initialize a new project typing /project followed by the name and the description like this: `/project MyApp My application is a simple chatbot using GPT2 Italian model`
2. Once you received project composition, files list and order execution just check for needed files and ask one by one this way: `/complete filename`
3. If all provided scripts are working as expected you'are done

### Tips

- you can also ask it to improve a single file by typing `/improve `and paste the file content you want to be improved
- you can ask to add `/logs` and `/debug` snippets for a better troubleshooting
- you can ask to evaluate compute resources needed to run the application by typing `/dim`
- you can ask to create a README.md file for the application Github repo by typing `/repo`

..and much more.. it is continuosly improved for any need ^_^

            <p class="description">Automate DNS updates and rollbacks across multiple providers using DNSControl and GitHub Actions.</p>
            <p># DNSControl Actions

Easily update, push, and rollback your DNS configuration using [DNSControl](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

[![Update DNS Configuration](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/dnscontrol-actions/actions/workflows/update.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/dnscontrol-actions/actions/workflows/update.yml) [![Rollback DNS Configuration](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/dnscontrol-actions/actions/workflows/rollback-latest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/dnscontrol-actions/actions/workflows/rollback-latest.yml)

## Features

- **DNS configuration CD/CI** using DNSControl and GitHub Actions.
- **Preview DNS changes** upon each update to dnsconfig.js.
- **Manual push** configuration for safer DNS updates.
- Option to **rollback to a previous DNS configuration** in case of errors.
- Support for **multiple DNS providers** for enhanced **redundancy**.
- Optional: send notification via Apprise on rollback

## How to Use

#### Initialization
- Clone or fork this repository
- If You forked it set repository visibility to **private**

#### Setup Credentials:
- Refer to creds.json for example configurations of popular DNS providers.
- Populate the appropriate fields with your credentials.
- For security, use repository action secrets for sensitive information (e.g., `CLOUDFLARE_API_USER` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).
- Remember to give workflows read/write permissions (https://github.com/user/repo/settings/actions)

#### Configure DNS:
- Edit and save your DNS settings in dnsconfig.js.
- This will automatically trigger the "Update DNS" action.

#### Push Configuration:
- After the update action has successfully executed, you can manually trigger the "Push Configuration" action to propagate DNS updates.

#### Rollback (if needed):
- If there are issues with the DNS update, manually trigger the "Rollback" action to restore the previous configuration.

## Advanced Configuration

- Multi-provider Redundancy: Define multiple DNS providers in dnsconfig.js to achieve redundancy across providers. Example: Using both Cloudflare and AWS.
- Note: When using Cloudflare's proxying feature in combination with another DNS provider, ensure you handle the logic behind these proxies.

### Configure the application
In the **Configuration** page (or by manually editing the `config.yaml` file) you will find all configuration options. You must change at least the source feeds you want to aggregate, the LLM API and model to use to rewrite the aggregated feeds. You can then retrieve the final `uglyfeed.xml` feed in many ways: 

- local filesystem
- download from web UI
- HTTP server url
- HTTPS GitHub CDN url

> You can easily extend it to send it to cms, notification or messaging systems.

### Execute the application scripts
Execute all scripts in the **Run scripts** page easily by clicking on the button **Run `main.py`, `llm_processor.py`, `json2rss.py` sequentially**.
You can check for logs, errors and informational messages.

### Serve the final rewritten XML feed via HTTP
Once all scripts completed go to the **View and Serve XML** page where you can view and download the generated XML feed. If you start the HTTP server you can access to the XML url at `http://container_ip:8001/uglyfeed.xml`

### Deploy the final rewritten XML feed to GitHub/GitLab
Once all scripts completed go to the **Deploy** page where you can push the final rewritten XML file to the configured GitHub/GitLab repository, the public XML URL to use by RSS readers is returned for each enabled platform.
